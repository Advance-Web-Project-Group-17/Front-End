# **Movie Review Web Application**

## **Project Description**

This project is a movie website where users can view movie details, submit reviews, and browse through user-generated reviews, make a group to discuss about the movie. The application allows users to rate movies, share their thoughts, and read others' feedback, make a list of favorite movie and user can also share profile and favorite list for other users. The movie details are fetched from a third-party API which is TMDB and Finkkino API, and the backend is integrated with a custom service.

This project has provided a valuable experience in full-stack development, working with React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and integrating with third-party APIs. It has allowed the team to focus on user interaction, API integration, and database management.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React, CSS Modules (for styling), Axios (for HTTP requests)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSql (for database management)
- **API Integration**: TMDB API, Finkkino API
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for handling user authentication
- **Deployment**: Microsoft Azure
- **Testing**: Mocha and Chai for backend testing

## **Project Team Members**

- **Tam Doan**: Full-stack Development - Login, Register, Authentication, overall project management
- **Shafiq**: Backend development - Search, Remove account
- **Sumaiya**: Backend development - Showtimes, Favorites
- **Nadeesha**: Backend development - Group feature
- **Shabnaz**: Full-stack Development - Review feature

## **Architecture and Database Structure**

### **Architecture**

The application follows a client-server architecture. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is powered by Node.js and Express. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful API calls using Axios. The backend fetches and stores reviews from the PostgreSql database.

1. **Users**: Stores user's information like user_name, email, password, and others statement use for this project
2. **Reviews**: Stores user reviews, including the movie ID, review text, rating, and the userâ€™s name.
3. **Groups**: Stores group's name and group's id
4. **Group_membership**: Stores member's name, group's name, group's id and is_admin statement of user
5. **Group's movies**: Stores movies or tv shows added by member
