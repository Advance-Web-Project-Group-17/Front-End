# **Movie Review Web Application**

## **Project Description**

This project is a movie website where users can view movie details, submit reviews, and browse through user-generated reviews, make a group to discuss about the movie. The application allows users to rate movies, share their thoughts, and read others' feedback, make a list of favorite movie and user can also share profile and favorite list for other users. The movie details are fetched from a third-party API which is TMDB and Finkkino API, and the backend is integrated with a custom service.

This project has provided a valuable experience in full-stack development, working with React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and integrating with third-party APIs. It has allowed the team to focus on user interaction, API integration, and database management.
